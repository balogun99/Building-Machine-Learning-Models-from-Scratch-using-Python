# Building-Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch-using-Python
This repository demonstrated the implementation of FOUR (4) Machine Learning Models from scratch using Python, and also using real-world datasets to demonstrates the performance of each models. The models built include; 1- Linear Regression  2- Logistic Regression. 3- Lasso Regression  4- Support Vector Machine.
